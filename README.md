# Data Mining & Data Warehousing Practical Assignments

This repository contains the implementation of practical assignments for the **Data Mining and Data Warehousing** course. Each practical demonstrates a core concept in data analysis, data preprocessing, data mining algorithms, or data warehousing techniques using Python.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Perform EDA on a given dataset to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, and check assumptions using visualizations and summary statistics.

2. **Handling Missing Values**  
   Demonstrate various techniques to treat missing data, including:
   - Mean/Median/Mode imputation
   - Forward/Backward Fill
   - Dropping missing records

3. **ETL Data Flow Transformations**  
   Implement data flow transformations commonly used in ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes such as:
   - Filtering
   - Mapping
   - Aggregation
   - Data type conversion

4. **Apriori Algorithm**  
   Use the Apriori algorithm to identify frequent itemsets and generate association rules from transactional datasets.

5. **Naive Bayes Algorithm**  
   Implement the Naive Bayes classifier for predictive analysis and evaluate its performance.

6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
   Apply the KNN algorithm for classification tasks using a labeled dataset.

7. **K-Means Clustering**  
   Perform unsupervised learning using K-Means clustering on a given dataset.

8. **Decision Tree Classifier**  
   Build and visualize a decision tree for classification problems.

9. **Linear Regression**  
    Implement simple and multiple linear regression models to predict a continuous variable.
